I'd like this first blog post to highlight who I am, what I am setting out to 
accomplish, and how I plan on getting there. I want to show you how you can benefit from following 
my journey, how to use the tools I discover along the way, and connect with me or get involved in different ways.

# Hello World

Welcome, and thanks for stopping by. I’m not quite sure how you found your way here or what brings you, but I’d like to make my intentions clear as I begin this journey.

Now in my thirties, I’ve been fascinated by technology for nearly twenty years. I was born at a perfect moment—old enough to grow up largely screen-free, immersed in the natural world, yet young enough to witness the rise of the internet and the Internet of Things. That balance taught me about people, the environment and the joy of exploration, free from the constant pull of social media and connected devices.

Over the past two decades I’ve watched technology blossom in ways I could never have imagined. I’ve never been a great traditional student, so after leaving high school early I took an unconventional path. I enrolled in software engineering courses at a local college, where I wrote my first programs.

Although I never finished that course because I needed to support myself, I fell in love with coding and kept going. After diving into HTML, CSS and JavaScript for web development, I discovered network engineering and enrolled in an intensive IT bootcamp. There I mastered TCP/IP fundamentals, routing, switching and firewall configuration. I applied those skills in the field, redesigning a state lottery’s entire network architecture on a multi-million-dollar budget, and learned firsthand how data really flows beneath the surface of the internet. That hands-on experience taught me what powers every device and connection I build today, and I’m grateful for every challenge it brought.

Here we are today. I’ve decided to rekindle that spark of obsession. I'm diving headfirst into everything that hypes me up and sharing the ride with anyone interested. You’ll see what I discover, how I tackle new challenges, and who I meet along the way when our interests overlap.

On this blog we’ll explore the full IoT playground: locking down systems with cybersecurity best practices, automating tasks in the CLI with Bash scripts, scraping and visualizing data in Python, and tinkering with hardware and Raspberry Pis. We’ll also dabble in AI experiments—and, because I’m a proud MTG and D&D nerd, expect a little TTRPG fun too. Pull up a chair and let’s build, learn, and geek out together.

Cheers,
Devin
